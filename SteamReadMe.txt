[h1]Quasimorph Spawn Monster Console Command[/h1]


Adds the dev console command spawn-monster-under-cursor.

[h1]Usage[/h1]

In combat (the dungeon), move the cursor to the location which the monster will spawn.
Open the console and type: spawn-monster-under-cursor and then the id of the monster to spawn.

Example: [i]spawn-monster-under-cursor possesed_man_worker[/i]

The unit will be spawned under the cursor.

[h1]Creature Id list.[/h1]

The list of creatures can be found at [i]%AppData%\..\LocalLow\Magnum Scriptum Ltd\QM_SpawnMonsterCommand\Creatures.txt[/i]
This list will be created after the mod has been installed and the game run once.

[h2]Auto Complete[/h2]

The command also supports auto complete. Type [i]spawn-monster-under-cursor [/i] (with a space) and type a partial name.  For example, 'man'.
Press tab and the list of monsters that include man will be listed.  Press up and down arrows to use an entry.

To list all of the creatures, use [i]_[/i] as the Id.
